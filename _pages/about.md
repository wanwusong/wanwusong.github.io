## 👤About Me {#about}
Hi! I am Peixuan Song (Chinese: 宋沛轩), a senior undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence and Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST).  
I will be joining Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (Tsinghua SIGS) as a graduate student in Fall 2026.  
My research interests lie in **reinforcement learning**, **robot learning**, and **embodied AI**, with a focus on enabling robots to acquire adaptive and generalizable skills in dynamic real-world environments.  
I am particularly excited about advancing embodied intelligence and bridging the gap between simulation and reality through learning-based approaches.
